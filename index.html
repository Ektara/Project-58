        <h1>why I love Baking?? </h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>1. Baking can be an “in the moment” experience. It is difficult to ruminate over an issue, when one is busy measuring and following directions, while keeping an eye on the clock and the oven.<br>
2. To me, baking can be a relaxing experience.<br>
3. Baking is an opportunity to develop new skills or to work on existing ones.<br>
4. I love that baking can be broken down into many individual disciplines and learning opportunities.<br>
5. I love that I have succeeded in folding egg whites without completely deflating batter.<br>
6. I love that baking is something for which I am passionate enough to make the time to keep trying.<br>
7. Baking is an opportunity to develop intuition for what will work and what won’t.
